## Overview

An MIT LICENSE library made to make packaging and loading of plugins easy for projects. Plugins can have their own dependencies packaged alongside their code. Dependencies are isolated from the main application as well to ensure different plugins can have their own versions of many dependencies.

## Features

- Packaging plugins into an archive (targz) with their pypi dependencies pre-packaged
- Plugin sorting/dependency sorting. Ensures that plugins will be loaded in the correct order.
- Plugin import hook to allow plugins to depend on each other or be imported by the main application itself..
- Customization of plugin loading- choose to load them via dynamic import (default) or use a custom loading strategy (for example, a custom, sandboxed environment).
- Plugin api versioning. Ensure plugins follow versioning standards
- Plugin Manager using the strategy pattern. Change any individual component to suit your needs.

## Features Not Provided
- Sandboxed loading strategy. Sandbox security is not our expertise. I would rather we provide only what we can reasonable ensure the quality of.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Plugin Signing

## Getting Started: Making a Plugin (Default Strategy):

Making a plugin is fairly simple. A plugin has a few basic parts:
- A `pyproject.toml` (optional)
- A `plugin.toml`
- A plugin entry point (default `__init__.py`, can be modified in your `plugin.toml`)

### pyproject.toml configuration options

All configuration options are listed below.

```toml
name = "exampleplugin"
author = ...
# Your full pyproject
# ...

[tool.plugin]

includes = ["mypy"]
# package includes. A list of strings. ONLY USE PACKAGE NAMES, NOT VERSIONS OR SPECIFIERS.
# It will use the version it finds first in your package search order.
# `includes` entries get added into a packaged plugin in a `site-packages` folder.

src="src/"
# source directory (a string). The default is "./".
# This option will change where it pulls your source data from
# this includes the location of your `plugin.toml`

# More options can be added by custom plugin loaders (obviously), so keep that in mind.
```

### plugin.toml configuration options

Your `plugin.toml` contains plugin specific information and WILL be packaged in your final plugin.

```toml
name = "ExamplePlugin"
author = "Abby"
entry = "main" # Entry file
version = "1.0" # plugin version

min_api_version = "0.1.0"
max_api_version = "0.1.10"

# versions can be formated as follows:
# - string: "major.minor[.<patch>[-<tag>]]"
# - table: {major=1, minor=0, patch=0, tag="Beta"}
# - list/tuple: [1, 0, 0, "beta"], [1, 0], [1, 0, 0]

# Additional required metadata may be required by custom plugin loaders.

# (Optional from here on)
dependencies = [
    {plugin_id="author.name", min_version="0.1.0", max_version="0.1.0"},
    # ... more dependencies
]

# you can add as much additional data as you want.
# It will get saved under "aditional_meta" in `PluginMetadata`
```

### main.py (our entry in this example)
```
# Whatever you want here!

print("Holy moly, we loaded it!")
```


### Final structure

Here is the final file structure of our plugin

```
exampleplugin/
├── .venv/ # our virtual environment during development
│   └── ...
├── .git/
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── plugin.toml
├── pyproject.toml
├── # misc
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── uv.lock
```


> Tip:
> When we lay it out like this, its easy to see why we should modify the `src` option
> in our `pyproject.toml`

### Packaging Our Plugin:
This heavily depends on your loading strategy, but there is a generic command provided.
It uses the default strategy.

```sh
uv run build-plugin ./ ./build
#                   ^     ^ 
#                   |     | - build/output directory
#                   |
#                   | - src directory (gets modified if a pyproject is present in that folder)
```

#### Alternatively: We Can Make a Build Script.
This should mostly be provided by the plugin api you are using or create, but for testing we can also just build out our own.

```python
plugin_api_version = ApiVersion(1, 0, None, None)

src = Path("./")
dest = src / "build"

meta_loader = DefaultMetadataLoader() # loads the metadata for our plugin
archiver = DefaultPluginArchiver()

# load our metadata and archive our plugin
meta = meta_loader.load_metadata(src, plugin_api_version)
archiver.archive_plugin(meta, src, dest)
```

## Getting Started: Loading plugins (Default Strategy):

### Project structure
```
ourproject/
├── .venv/ # our virtual environment during development
│   └── ...
├── .git/
│   └── ...
├── plugins/
│   └── Abby.ExamplePlugin.tar.gz # our example plugin!
├── src/
│   ├── ourproject/ # plugin api
│   │   └── ...
│   └── main.py # Our application
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── uv.lock
```

### Loading plugins

Loading plugins is actually fairly easy (assuming you are okay with the defaults).

```python
from openpluginloader.defaultstrategy import create_default_manager
from openpluginloader.versioning import ApiVersion
from openpluginloader.utility import set_default_module_cache

from pathlib import Path

import ourproject # import our plugin api. 

# makes our current imports available to plugins. VERY IMPORTANT
set_default_module_cache()
# You can also manually set `utility.DEFAULT_MODS` if you want more careful control
# Do not every set `utility.DEFAULT_MODS` to a new instance. Only modify in-place

API_VERSION = ApiVersion(1, 0, 0, "release")

manager = create_default_manager(API_VERSION, Path("plugins/"))
manager.initialize_hooks() # initialize very important import hooks

plugins = manager.discover_plugins() # discovers plugins and sorts them.
manager.load_all_plugins()
```

### Loading individual plugins:
```python
from openpluginloader.defaultstrategy import create_default_manager
from openpluginloader.versioning import ApiVersion
from openpluginloader.utility import set_default_module_cache

from pathlib import Path

import ourproject # import our plugin api. 

# makes our current imports available to plugins. VERY IMPORTANT
set_default_module_cache()
# You can also manually set `utility.DEFAULT_MODS` if you want more careful control
# Do not every set `utility.DEFAULT_MODS` to a new instance. Only modify in-place

API_VERSION = ApiVersion(1, 0, 0, None)

manager = create_default_manager(API_VERSION, Path("plugins/"))
manager.initialize_hooks() # initialize very important import hooks

plugins = manager.discover_plugins() # discovers plugins and sorts them.

import plugins.ExamplePlugin # imports `__init__.py` from our ExamplePlugin
# alternatively
import plugins.ExamplePlugin.__ENTRY__ # imports a plugin's entry point (defined in plugin.toml)
# alternatively again
import plugins.ExamplePlugin.main # import a specific module from ExamplePlugin
```

> Plugins can use these fancy plugin imports too! Keep that in mind!
